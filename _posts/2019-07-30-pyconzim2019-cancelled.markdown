### PyCon Zimbabwe 2019 cancelled

Python Zimbabwe  will not host Pycon Zimbabwe in  2019.  The decision has been  a very difficut one and has been taken after much thought, soul-searching and discussion. Our country is faced with a myriad of challenges economically. It is within this context that we as Python Zimbabwe  cannot responsibly commit to presenting a feasible and viable event this year of the same quality and impact that we have presented over the past three years. We will use the remaining time to plan for a bigger and improved conference to be held in April 2020. We will also be continuing with our mission of promoting the use of the python programming language in Zimbabwe and beyond. Local events to look out for this year are: Django Indaba, Pyladies, Django Girls Harare, Django Girls Bulawayo and PyData Harare.
 

We look forward to meeting Python programmers, enthusiasts and students in Harare, April 2020.
